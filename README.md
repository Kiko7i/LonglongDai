## About me
I'm a first-year master's student from [State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes deep learning, remote sensing, hyperspectral, image processing, and wetland mapping.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongyan Zhang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/zhanghongyan1/zh_CN/index.htm) from China University of Geosciences (wuhan), and [Prof. Wei He](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/hewei5/zh_CN/index.htm) from Wuhan University.
